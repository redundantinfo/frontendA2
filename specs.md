Visitors should be able to:

Get information about movies being shown, incl. dates and times.

Be able to see a list of screenings.
Screenings are sorted by the date they the movies are shown.
Each date displayed as a seperate headline (including date and weekday).
For each screening, the date and time of the screening and the title, movie poster and length (in hours and minutes) of the movie should be shown.

You should be able to filter this list by category.

When you click on a movie in the list, you should be transfered to the booking page where you can choose your seats.

The seats should be displayed as follows:
A graphic view of the auditorium and its seats.
You should be able to book a number of adjacent seats during a specific screening of a film.
You should be able to see which seats are available and which are already booked.
You should be able to see which seats you have chosen.

The seats should be numbered from right to left, front to back. (The chair at the front right has the number 1. If the salon has 100 chairs, the one at the furthest back and to the left has the number 100.)
If you are booking more than one seat, you should only be able to book seats that are next to each other. (You can’t book seat 1 and 3, but you can book 1 and 2.).

While booking, you should be able to choose the number of visitors and see the total price.

Seniors (above the age of 65) and children (under the of 12) should have a lower ticket price.
The normal ticket price is SEK 85, seniors SEK 75, children SEK 65.
