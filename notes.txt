1. I need to figure out how the backend works. I should probably create some simple fetches and see what comes back.
Without knowing how the data is returned, it's hard to implement anything on the frontend.

GET /api/table
Get all records from a table or view.

GET /api/table/:id
Write an id after the table name and /. to retrieve a record with a specific id. (Works for those tables and views that have id column.)

NOTE ON VIEW VS TABLE:

VIEW:
In frontend development, a "view" typically refers to a visual representation or presentation of data. 
It can be a specific section or component of a web page that displays information to the user. 
A view is responsible for rendering data and providing an interface for the user to interact with.

TABLE:
A "table" refers to a specific UI component that is commonly used to organize and display structured data in rows and columns. 
It is a way to present tabular data in a structured format, often resembling a grid. 
Tables can be used to represent various types of data, such as user information, product listings, or financial records.
