1. I need to figure out how the backend works. I should probably create some simple fetches and see what comes back.
Without knowing how the data is returned, it's hard to implement anything on the frontend.

GET /api/table
Get all records from a table or view.

GET /api/table/:id
Write an id after the table name and /. to retrieve a record with a specific id. (Works for those tables and views that have id column.)
